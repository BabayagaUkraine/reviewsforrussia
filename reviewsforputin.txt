BARS

A Ukrainian walked into this bar. The bartender served him a drink for free. We all joined him at the bar, and wept for his home.

Wow! Got so drunk here, super good time. It almost made me forget about how Ukrainians are being forced out of their own country so Putin can pretend he's a big man.

Ugh, so hung over. But this place was great! Cheap drinks, good company, and a total lack of guilt over the atrocities being committed on my country's behalf.

Couldn't even find my way home last night. Came back to the bar, and they gave me water and food. Soooooo thankful they are treating me like a Russian, and not a Ukrainian.


RESTAURANTS

Best VODKA around! Unfortunately I had a little too much and started telling people the truth about Russia’s vicious invasion of their Ukrainian neighbors. I got arrested and had to spend a day in jail, but a day in jail is worth putting a stop to this evil war.

Oooooh man, really enjoyed the pelmeni, filled my stomach. It’s too bad the Russian soldiers being forced to invade Ukraine don’t have full stomachs. Their leaders don’t even send their bodies back to their Russian families because that might reveal the truth about Putin’s horrifying war on a sovereign nation. Why are Russians there? I guess the FSB is why.

Good food, great service. Paid my bill and realized the taxes were helping fund a war on an independent country. Food didn’t taste so good after that.

OTHER RANDOM BUSINESSES

Really great establishment. Loved my experience. Unfortunately, made me start thinking about how places like this are no longer open in Ukraine because they've been bombed by Putin.

Great experience here. Great time. Seems pointless though when Ukrainians are being bombed in their homes, their borders being invaded, and their childred being killed. Too bad about that. Ah well.

Nice place! :) Impressed. Only bad thing was that Russian citizens are being tricked by the Eff Ess Bee into believing that there’s no war going on. I guess that's what they mean when they say "service."

Very happy with how it turned out. The visit here, I mean. Not the ongoing crisis in Ukraine and the fact that Russian citizens have been tricked into participating in a war they don’t want. Guess we all have to bow down to Putin, though, as he’s our emperor.

Awesome place, good people, great time. I’d visit again, but Putin the Mad has made that hard with his insane war in Ukraine. Won’t be visiting again until people in Ukraine can visit places like this without being afraid of bombings.

This was an excellent establishment, and I hope it continues to thrive and the people here are happy. They should share some of their prosperity with the refugees fleeing Ukraine because of Russian bombs. The taxes collected here help fuel Putin’s machine of war.

Everyone here was smiling and couldn’t be happier. Unlike the people of Ukraine, who weep over their slaughtered children and scream in anger over Putin’s foolish and failing plan to invade their sovereign country. But at least the people here are happy.

What an interesting place, with so much to see. The workers were a delight to meet. Hopefully the Kremlin doesn’t send them on “training exercises” as they’d probably end up in the Ukrainian war zone. If that happens that might really hurt their business.

I sent my friend here because I liked it so much. Then I was sent on a training exercise. For the first time in my life, I hold an assault rifle in my hand. I'm told to kill Ukrainians. I don't know why I must kill Ukrainians. I don't want to be here. Please, take me home. Please, I'm begging you.


RANDOM

Since we're adding a review,
a little poem for you:
for all the bad Russian boys and girls,
Baba Yaga will find you.
Even as the Kremlin hurls
bombs at Ukraine and puts Russians to the screw
Baba Yaga will still find you.
While Putin may be naughty
and the FSB ruthless,
you Russians can agree
that this invasion is useless.
And you good Russian people,
Baba Yaga won't get you,
unless you keep silent, then
Baba Yaga will find you.
